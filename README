FAQ:
How is the developing method?
1) Using branch devvel(means hitting hard something & someone)
2) Bum what you like to hack. Notice that all (necessary) files in devvel branch is linking with each other.

Why not using multi-line CSS in the main js file?
I think it's more user friendly to all,
with standalone CSS file & merge into main js benefits:
1) Missing tailling character won't break all js file at once.
2) It's better for ajust CSS codes.
3) You won't handle with 1000+ dyanmic js code.

Why beauty?
That's what it designed to be, both the target & codes.
P.S. Codes ought to get pass jsLint(sloppy for now)

Why there is night.css but not day.css?
I think it's ok for the default looking of the result which generated by `hacer'.
In fact, there is varible named altCSS in main js which original called dayCSS 
working as alternative CSS against the night vision.
You can ajust altCSS via the SETTING and if you think it's necessary for all to
enjoy the beauty you created, pull the request.
